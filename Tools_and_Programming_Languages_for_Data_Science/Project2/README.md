For this project we should write a function to make API calls to a Worldbank data source.
Furthermore we got a csv file with the medal table of the olympic games from 2012. 
We should combine the medal table with an API call and merge the data to one data frame, to answer some questions.
Finally there is also an exercise that deals with a prediction model through linear regression.
Just have a look into the PDF file if you are interested what I was supposed to do.
