During the semester we had to submit 2 problemsets as part of our final grade.
At the moment you can just find problemset 2 here, as the first problemset was a theoretical task without any coding.
For problemset 2 we had a data set of air pollution data. We should find an interesting story to tell and just use
visualizations (without additional text).
