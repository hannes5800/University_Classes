For this class the examination consisted of 2 parts.
Part 1 was an in-class programming examination with SQL (can't provide this part).
Part 2 is available in this repository and you can read the detailed task in the PDF file "Examination_Part_2.pdf".
In this PDF file you will see 2 main tasks: "Open-Data Schleswig Holstein" and "Open Data Platform", which were again 2 different tasks.
My final submission for "Open-Data Schleswig Holstein" was the Notebook "Open_Data_Schleswig_Holstein.ipynb".
My final presentation for "Open Data Platform" was the PDF file "ECB_Open_Data_PDF_optimized.pdf", including a demo request 
"ECB_Presentation_API_example.ipynb".
