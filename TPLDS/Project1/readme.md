For this project we got six csv files with results of the olympic games from 2006 to 2016. 
Furthermore there is an excel file with two sheets, containing metadata about the olympics themselves and about the athletes. 
Generally my task was to clean up and merge the data sets, as well as performing some exploratory data analysis. 
Just have a look into the PDF file if you are interested what I was supposed to do. 
Note that in the beginning I had to do some data exploration, which I don't include in the notebook explicitly. Maybe I will add it later.
