    "I decided that my function should take three lists for the arguments. \n",
    "For the \"indicators\" argument a list must be provided and the elements must be strings. The same applies for the \"countries\" argument. The \"years\" list can just contain one single year or two years if a time range should be evaluated. In the latter case the smaller/earlier year number will be used as the beginning of the range and the greater/later year number as the end, even if someone would provide it the opposite way. Furthermore it doesn't matter if the years within the list are provided as ints, floats or strings. In any case my function transforms it in a way, that it can be used for the API call. Also, if some argument isn't provided the right way, my function prints an error message with a hint how the respective argument should be typed in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally my function iterates over the indicators list. For every indicator my function uses all provided countries and all provided years to make one API call. But as the API just returns the 50 items per page by default, there could be many cases where my function would have to make multiple requests (one for each page). Therefore, when the function made the first call for an indicator it checks the total number of items in the response. If the total number of items is <= 50, all items are one the first page and no modification has to be made. Otherwise the function makes a new API call, but now setting the \"per_page\" argument in the URL with the total number of items. Then we would get all items on one page. So there are AT MOST two calls for each indicator: one if total number of items <= 50 or two if total number of items > 50. Also responses will always be given in json format, as I set the parameter this way.\n",

    "From the responses the function will collect certain information which will be stored in lists. These lists will be used at the end to create entries for the df. Each entry/row will contain the country name, the specific year, indicator ID, indicator in written format (indicator IDs aren't really self-explanatory) and the realized value of the indicator."

    "First I read in the medal table csv and store in the variable \"medal_table\". As i want to join the dfs \"medal_table\" and \"pop_gdp_lifeexp_all_2012\" via the country names, I need the country names to match exactly. So I checked which countries from the medal table are not found in the \"country_name\" column of the \"pop_gdp_lifeexp_all_2012\" df. Indeed there were some countries which couldn't be found, however not because they were really missing but just because they had a different name in \"pop_gdp_lifeexp_all_2012\". I decided to replace these country names in the medal table with the country names as they are specified in \"pop_gdp_lifeexp_all_2012\", because the df \"medal_table\" is smaller. Unfortunately there was one country from the medal table which really isn't included in the other df and that's Chinese Taipei (better kown as Taiwan). After some research I found out that the Worldbank doesn't collect information about Taiwan and it's also not included in the values for China but just for some worldwide evaluatios. After all I decided to drop Chinese Taipei/Taiwan from the medal table, because it doesn't have any usecase for the follwoing tasks if there is no data in the Worldbank df. In the end I add a column with the total number of medals (sum up gold, silver and bronze) for each country which will be used in exercise 3:"

By doing this, the model tries to find the best fitting line through the data, which is the line that minimizes the mean squared error. Finally I want to evaluate how good the model is. Therefore I use the X_test data to make predictions about the outcomes. Comparing these outcomes with the y_test data (which are the TRUE amounts of medals won by countries) will show how well the model fits.

    "The root mean squared error measures the average distance of the data points from the regression line. As my model's RMSE is 5.579, it means that on average my model predicts that a country has 5.579 more or less medals than this country would have in reality. Considering that in 2012 the USA had the most medals with 104 in total, this means my model is around 5 % away from the truth (always remembering that rmse is an average distance). This would be kind of okay if all countries would have won that amound of medals. But the problem is that our df contains 84 countries and out of these there are just 5 which won more than 40 medals in total. Therefore the average error is quite high for the majority of countries."

    "\n",
    "The reason for this performance might be the fact that the RMSE is prone to outliers (e.g. USA). Also there might be some kind of multicollinearity, which means that two or more independent variables have a strong correlation with each other. Multicollinearity can lead to a higher RMSE, so that might be an issue here. Another aspect could be that a linear regression model is just not the best model in this case and we should use some other kind of regression (logistic, polynomial, ridge regression)."

    "\n",
    "I already mentioned the proneness of the RMSE to outliers, so maybe we should exclude these outliers when we train our model. Someone could argue that we might use more independent variables for improvement. And that's not even wrong, because more independet variables reduce the RMSE value in ANY case, even if it doesn't make any sense. Considering this we should think about using independent variables that could really impact the overall performance of a country in the olympics. So the quality (or sense) of the indipendent variables should be more important than the quantity. For example we could replace the GDP with another monetary value, for example the amount of money a countrie government puts into the development of professional sports infrastructure. And/or for every country we could try to find out how many people are active in sports in general. Maybe societies with a higher percentage of people that do some kind of sports also perform better in the olympics. This metric could be more fitting than just using the total population number."
